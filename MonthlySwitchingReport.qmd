# SWITCHING DATA

Include data like:
- How many customers did we start the month with on the database
- How many customers did we end the month with on the database
- Showing the net movement.

- Then say how many new customers, reactivated, increased loyalty etc etc
- Could also include some profiling of key attributes as well
- But mainly data from the loyalty dash
- And could possibly link off to that in the report.


```{r}
#| label: Number Responses

# Count how many responses.

completedResponses <-switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth) %>%
  summarise(n=n())

completedResponsesValue <- completedResponses[[1]]

```

# RESEARCH RESPONSES

In the latest month of data collection we had `r completedResponsesValue` completed responses.

The share of customer self-evaluated changing loyalty levels in the latest month are as follows:

```{r}
#| label: Loyalty Change

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth) %>%
  group_by(loyaltyChange) %>%
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = round(n/sum(n),3)) %>%
  mutate(perc = percent(freq,accuracy = 0.1)) %>%
  select(-freq)

### Where are customers switching their spend from?

For customers increasing in loyalty (New to Gopuff, Recently Reactivated or Increasing their Spend vs the Previous Month), these are the retailers customers are switching from:

```{r}
#| label: Shop Less Retailers

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth, Q1 %in% c(1,2,3)) %>%
  group_by(shopLess) %>%
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = round(n/sum(n),3)) %>%
  mutate(perc = percent(freq,accuracy = 0.1)) %>%
  select(-freq) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

```
<br>
<br>
Responses for people that stated 'Other':
<br>
<br>
```{r}
#| label: Shop less other responses

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth) %>%
  select (Q5) %>%
  filter(Q5 != "N/A")
```

### Why did they choose to switch more of their spend to Gopuff?

Open ended answers:

Cohort 1 (New): "I Made my First Transaction with Gopuff in the Last Month"

```{r}
#| label: Shop less - open ended reasons - New

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth, Q1 == 1) %>%
  select (Q6) %>%
  filter(Q6 != "N/A")
```

Cohort 2 (Reactivated): "I ordered from Gopuff in the last month, after having previously not shopped with Gopuff for a while."

```{r}
#| label: Shop less - open ended reasons - Reactivated

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth, Q1 == 2) %>%
  select (Q6) %>%
  filter(Q6 != "N/A")
```

Cohort 3 (Increasing Loyalty): "I regularly shop with Gopuff, and ordered more than usual in the last month."

```{r}
#| label: Shop less - open ended reasons - Increased loyalty

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth, Q1 == 3) %>%
  select (Q6) %>%
  filter(Q6 != "N/A")
```

And when we asked customers to pick from a list (with the option of picking multiple reasons), these were the top reasons for why they chose to switch to spending more with Gopuff:
