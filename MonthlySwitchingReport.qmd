```


A report to describe the current size of our database, churn and reactivation trends over time and then (based on our customer surveys) where and why are we gaining and losing customers.

Research data is collected on a monthly basis, with respondents selected based on their changing loyalty habits in the previous month.



# OUR CUSTOMER DATABASE SIZE AND MOVEMENTS


## DATABASE SIZE

```{r}
#| label: How many active customers this month vs last month values

totalDBTM <- databaseSize %>%
  filter(SEGMENT_8 != 'Lapsed', SEGMENT_8 != 'Churned') %>%
  summarise(Total_TM = sum(CURRENT_VOLUMES))

totalDBTMValue<- totalDBTM[[1]]

totalDBLM <- databaseSize %>%
  filter(SEGMENT_8 != 'Lapsed', SEGMENT_8 != 'Churned') %>%
  summarise(Total_LM = sum(FOUR_WEEKS_AGO))

totalDBLMValue<- totalDBLM[[1]]

totalDBDeltaValue <- totalDBTMValue - totalDBLMValue
```

On `r currentDate`, our total Active Database Size (based on the volume of customers that have placed at least one order in the last 28 days) was `r totalDBTMValue`.

Last Month, the Active Database Size was `r totalDBLMValue`.

The Active Database has therefore changed by `r totalDBDeltaValue` vs last month.

The following table shows how the database size has changed by Loyalty Segment (Including the size of the recently 'lapsed' and longer term 'churned' customer pool as well):

```{r}
#| label: How many active customers this month vs last month table

databaseSize %>%
  mutate(DELTA = CURRENT_VOLUMES - FOUR_WEEKS_AGO) %>%
  arrange(match(SEGMENT_8, c("Uber Value","High Value","Medium Value","Low Value", "New","Reactivated","Lapsed")), desc(SEGMENT_8)) 

```

For more details on customer movements between different loyalty segments, please refer to our Loyalty Segmentation Dashboard here: https://gopuff.looker.com/dashboards/5214

## CHURN AND REACTIVATION RATE

The following chart shows the trended churn rate over the last three months. Each data point represents what % of customers on a daily basis were active 28 days ago, but have now lapsed.

```{r}
#| label: Churn Rate Chart

ggplot(trendedMetrics, aes(x = CURRENT_SEGMENT_DATE, y = CHURN_RATE, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(size = 2, colour = "#006CD9") +
    labs(x = element_blank(),
       y = element_blank(),
       title = "Rolling Daily Churn Rate for the Last 3 Months" ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(family = 'Poppins-Black'),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,0.5),labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100))

```

The following chart shows the trended reactivation rate over the last three months. Each data point represents what % of customers on a daily basis were lapsed 28 days ago, but are now active.

```{r}
#| label: Reactivation Rate Chart

ggplot(trendedMetrics, aes(x = CURRENT_SEGMENT_DATE, y = REACTIVATED_RATE, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(size = 2, colour = "#006CD9") +
    labs(x = element_blank(),
       y = element_blank(),
       title = "Rolling Daily Reactivation Rate for the Last 3 Months" ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(family = 'Poppins-Black'),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,0.5),labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100))

```





# RESEARCH RESPONSES

```{r}
#| label: Number Responses

# Count how many responses.

completedResponses <-switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth) %>%
  summarise(n=n())

completedResponsesValue <- completedResponses[[1]]

```

In the latest month of data collection for our Switching Survey we had `r completedResponsesValue` completed responses.

Customers described their changing loyalty habits with Gopuff in the last month as follows:

```{r}
#| label: Loyalty Change

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth) %>%
  group_by(loyaltyChange) %>%
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = round(n/sum(n),3)) %>%
  mutate(perc = percent(freq,accuracy = 1)) %>%
  select(-freq)

```


## CUSTOMERS INCREASING THEIR LOYALTY TO GOPUFF

### Awareness

For customers that made their first transaction with Gopuff in the last month, where did they originally hear about Gopuff?

```{r}

dataAwarenessTable <- rbind(aw1, aw2, aw3, aw4, aw5, aw6, aw7, aw8, aw9, aw10, aw11) 


dataAwarenessTable %>%
  inner_join(totalResponses, by = "reportPeriod") %>%
 arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  mutate(freq = round(n/total,3)) %>%
  #mutate(perc = percent(freq, accuracy = 0.1)) %>%
  select(- total, -n) %>%
   spread(reportPeriod, freq) %>%
  arrange(desc(.[ncol(.)])) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric),function(x) percent(x,accuracy = 1))) 
  
```

<br>
<br>
Responses for people that stated 'Other':
<br>
<br>

```{r}
#| label: Awareness other responses

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth) %>%
  select (Q3) %>%
  filter(Q3 != "N/A")
```

### Where are customers switching their spend from?

For customers increasing in loyalty (New to Gopuff, Recently Reactivated or Increasing their Spend vs the Previous Month), these are the retailers customers are switching from over the past few months:

```{r}
#| label: Shop Less Trended
#| message: false 

switchingData %>%
  filter(Q1 %in% c(1,2,3)) %>%
  group_by(reportPeriod, shopLess) %>%
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = round(n/sum(n),3)) %>%
  select(reportPeriod, shopLess, freq) %>%
  spread(reportPeriod, freq) %>%
  arrange(desc(.[ncol(.)])) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric),function(x) percent(x,accuracy = 1))) 


```


<br>
<br>
Responses for people that stated 'Other' in the latest month:
<br>
<br>
```{r}
#| label: Shop less other responses

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth) %>%
  select (Q5) %>%
  filter(Q5 != "N/A")
```

<br>
<br>


### Why did customers choose to switch more of their spend to Gopuff?

Open ended answers that respondents provided, split by increasing loyalty cohort:

Cohort 1 (New): "I Made my First Transaction with Gopuff in the Last Month"

```{r}
#| label: Shop less - open ended reasons - New

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth, Q1 == 1) %>%
  select (Q6) %>%
  filter(Q6 != "N/A")
```

<br>
<br>

Cohort 2 (Reactivated): "I ordered from Gopuff in the last month, after having previously not shopped with Gopuff for a while."

```{r}
#| label: Shop less - open ended reasons - Reactivated

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth, Q1 == 2) %>%
  select (Q6) %>%
  filter(Q6 != "N/A")
```

<br>
<br>

Cohort 3 (Increasing Loyalty): "I regularly shop with Gopuff, and ordered more than usual in the last month."

```{r}
#| label: Shop less - open ended reasons - Increased loyalty

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth, Q1 == 3) %>%
  select (Q6) %>%
  filter(Q6 != "N/A")
```

<br>
<br>

And when we asked customers to pick from a list (with the option of picking multiple reasons), these were the top reasons for why they chose to switch to spending more with Gopuff:


```{r}

## CUSTOMERS DECREASING THEIR LOYALTY TO GOPUFF


### Where are customers switching their spend to?

For customers decreasing in loyalty (Decreasing their Spend vs the Previous Month or Lapsing in total), these are the retailers customers are switching to:

```{r}

### Why did they choose to switch more of their spend away from Gopuff?

Open ended answers that respondents provided, split by decreasing loyalty cohort:

Cohort 1 (Decreasing Loyalty): "I regularly shop with Gopuff, but ordered less than usual in the last month"

```{r}
#| label: Shop less - open ended reasons - Declining Loyalty

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth, Q1 == 5) %>%
  select (Q13) %>%
  filter(Q13 != "N/A")
```

<br>

Cohort 2 (Lapsed): "I did not purchase from Gopuff last month."

```{r}
#| label: Shop less - open ended reasons - Lapsed

switchingData %>%
  filter(reportPeriod == reportMonth, Q1 == 6) %>%
  select (Q13) %>%
  filter(Q13 != "N/A")
```

And when we asked customers to pick from a list (with the option of picking multiple reasons), these were the top reasons for why they chose to switch to spending less with Gopuff:
